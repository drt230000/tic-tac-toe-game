# Title: Tic-tac-toe-game

## Description
This program will generate a tic-tac-toe game between two players. A box-like template will be displayed, and the player's input will determine where they place their marks (X,O). 

## Features
- Feature 1: Template 
	- A box-like template will be shown depicting the box used in tic-tac-toe. It will be located in the output of the terminal.
- Feature 2: Player markings
	- Executed location determined by player's input. I am planning on using numbers 1-9 to plot the locations. I also want the marks to be in two colors to separate player 1 from player 2.
- Feature 3: Winner
	- Winner (player 1 or player 2) will be stated as the output in the terminal. If no winner is present, "no winner" will be stated in the terminal. I was also thinking about displaying confetti with the color responding to the player who won. 

## Challenges
- How to get the template correctly displayed in the terminal, and how to get the numbers to correspond to the locations.
- How to get the program to recognize who won, or if there is no winner present.
- How to display the confetti. Where will it be located? Will it move, or be a still image?

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Box-shape is displayed in the terminal. 
- X's and O's are placed inside the box depending on where the player locates them.
- Depending on who wins, player's name will be stated. ("Player 1/2 wins!")
- Colored confetti displayed; color will correspond to winner's color. 
- If no one wins, "No winner!" will be stated along with no confetti.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- As long as the game is functional (X's and O's can be placed in box, and results can be stated) then it can be considered successful.
